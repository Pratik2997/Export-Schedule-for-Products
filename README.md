# Export-Schedule-for-Products
An export schedule for your woocommerce or other products in a tabular format with order period date range, export date and the receiving estimated date.

This plugin works by adding the shortcode [es_table].
Just add it to any post/post-type and watch the magic happen.

Issue #1: The schedules are in descending order of the recently posted schedules. It needs to be in descending order of the most recent order period.
